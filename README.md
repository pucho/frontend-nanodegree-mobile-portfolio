## Optimized portfolio project

### Getting started

#### Run the portfolio website locally

#### OSX:

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080



#### Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

1. Changed the way the resizePizzas function works to load all the
pizza divs at once and then change the percentages for each one.

2. Changed how the pizzas move in the background to make it more performant.
